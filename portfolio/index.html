      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I am an aspiring web developer with a strong interest in creating modern and user-friendly websites. My focus is onbuilding clean, responsive designs 
        that not only look good but also provide a smooth experience for users.Over time, I have worked on small projects such as landing pages, calculators, and
         portfolio websites, which have helped me strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy taking on new challenges and continuously improving 
         my skills with each project I complete.

What excites me most about web development is the opportunity to turn ideas into real, functional websites that can make an impact. My long-term goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects where creativity and problem-solving come together.</p>
